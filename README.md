This repository contains a TypeScript code example demonstrating a subtle type inference issue. The `greet` function takes a string and a Date object as arguments. However, there's a potential problem in how the Date object is handled, especially regarding type safety and potential runtime errors.  The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version that addresses the type inference concern.  Understanding this helps in writing robust and type-safe TypeScript code.
